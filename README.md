Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   git clone https://github.com/sunnyaiml/fraud_detection.git
   cd fraud_detection

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):  
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scriptsctivate

3. **Install dependencies**:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** to explore the EDA and model training:  
   jupyter notebook

## 📈 **Model Performance**  

| **Metric**       | **Value**       |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Accuracy**     | 95%             |
| **Precision**    | 93%             |
| **Recall**       | 90%             |
| **F1-Score**     | 91%             |

> **Note**: Model performance may vary depending on the dataset used and the hyperparameters chosen.

## 📚 **How It Works**  

1. **Data Collection**: The system ingests transactional data.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and encodes categorical features.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts features like transaction amount, location, and user behavior.  
4. **Model Training**: Fits the model on historical data and tunes hyperparameters to achieve better accuracy.  
5. **Prediction**: For every new transaction, the system predicts if it is fraudulent or not.

## 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

During the EDA phase, we analyze key features to understand their impact on fraudulent activity. Some key EDA insights include:  

- **Correlation Heatmap**: Identifies relationships between features.  
- **Transaction Amount Distribution**: Analyzes transaction amounts to detect outliers.  
- **Fraud Frequency**: Checks the percentage of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.  

---

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**  

- Implement **Deep Learning models** for enhanced prediction accuracy.  
- Add **real-time prediction** capability using Flask or FastAPI.  
- Incorporate **unsupervised learning** to detect unknown fraud patterns.  
- Build a **dashboard** to visualize model performance and transaction history.
